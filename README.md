## About the Book
Pentaho Data Integration(PDI) is an intuitive and graphical environment packed with drag-and-drop design and powerful Extract-Tranform-Load (ETL) capabilities.

This book shows and explains the new interactive features of Spoon, the revamped look and feel, and the newest features of the tool including Transformations and Jobs Executors and the invaluable Metadata Injection capability.

We begin with the installation of PDI software and then move on to cover all the key PDI concepts. Each of the chapter introduces new features, enabling you to gradually get practicing with the tool. First, you will learn to do all kinds of data manipulation and work with simple plain files. Then, the book teaches you how you can work with relational databases inside PDI. Moreover, you will be given a primer on data warehouse concepts and you will learn how to load data in a data warehouse. During the course of this book, you will be familiarized with its intuitive, graphical and drag-and-drop design environment.

By the end of this book, you will learn everything you need to know in order to meet your data manipulation requirements. Besides, your will be given best practices and advises for designing and deploying your projects.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
project_name,start_date,end_date
Project A,2016-01-10,2016-01-25
Project B,2016-04-03,2016-07-21
Project C,2017-01-15,???

PDI is a multiplatform tool. This means that no matter which operating system you have, you will be able to work with the tool. The only prerequisite is to have JVM 1.8 installed. You will also need an Office suite, for example, Open Office or Libre Office, and a good text editor, for example, Sublime III or Notepad ++. Access to a relational database is recommended. Suggested engines are MySQL and PostgreSQL, but could be others of your choice as well.

Having an internet connection while reading is extremely useful too. Several links are provided throughout the book that complements what is explained. Besides, there is the PDI forum where you may search or post doubts if you are stuck with something.
